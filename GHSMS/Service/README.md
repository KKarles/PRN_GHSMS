# Service Layer - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Service Layer is now fully implemented following the specified patterns with comprehensive business logic, error handling, and standardized responses using ResultModel.

## ✅ Completed Components

### **Core Models & DTOs**
- `ResultModel` - Standardized API response wrapper with success/error handling
- `UserDTOs` - Registration, Login, Profile, Update, ChangePassword
- `ServiceDTOs` - Service catalog management (Create, Update, Service, Analyte)
- `TestBookingDTOs` - Booking workflow (Create, Update, Stats)
- `TestResultDTOs` - Test result management (Create, Update, Details)
- `MenstrualCycleDTOs` - Cycle tracking (Create, Update, Predictions)
- `DashboardDTOs` - Dashboard statistics and analytics

### **Service Implementations**

#### **1. UserService** ✅
- User registration with email validation and password hashing
- Login with credential verification
- Profile management (get, update)
- Password change functionality
- Role assignment/removal (Admin functions)
- Notification preferences management
- User filtering by roles and notification settings

#### **2. ServiceCatalogService** ✅
- Complete CRUD operations for services
- Service filtering by type and price range
- Analyte management and service-analyte relationships
- Vietnamese language support for service descriptions
- Service validation and conflict checking

#### **3. TestBookingService** ✅
- Booking creation with validation
- Status workflow management: `Booked → SampleCollected → Processing → ResultReady → Completed`
- Customer booking history
- Staff booking management by status
- Revenue calculation and booking statistics
- Booking cancellation with business rules
- Date range filtering and reporting

#### **4. TestResultService** ✅
- Test result creation with multiple analyte details
- Result validation against booking status
- Customer result access
- Staff result management
- Result updating and deletion
- Automatic booking status updates when results are ready

#### **5. MenstrualCycleService** ✅
- Cycle tracking (start/end dates)
- Cycle predictions (next period, ovulation, fertile window)
- Cycle regularity calculations
- User notification management
- Active cycle monitoring
- Date range filtering and analytics

#### **6. DashboardService** ✅
- Comprehensive dashboard statistics
- Revenue analytics (total, monthly, weekly, daily)
- User statistics and registration trends
- Booking analytics and service popularity
- Monthly revenue trends
- Service performance metrics
- Real-time KPI calculations

### **Dependency Injection** ✅
- All services registered with scoped lifetime
- Repository dependencies properly injected
- Generic repositories for supporting entities
- Clean separation of concerns

## **Key Features Implemented**

### **Business Logic**
- ✅ User authentication and authorization
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Test booking workflow with status validation
- ✅ Revenue tracking and reporting
- ✅ Health tracking with cycle predictions
- ✅ Notification system integration points
- ✅ Data validation and business rule enforcement

### **Error Handling**
- ✅ Consistent try-catch patterns
- ✅ HTTP status code mapping
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ Not found and conflict scenarios

### **Data Operations**
- ✅ CRUD operations for all entities
- ✅ Complex queries with filtering
- ✅ Aggregation and statistics
- ✅ Transaction management
- ✅ Relationship management

## **Integration Points Ready**

### **For API Layer**
- All services return `ResultModel` for consistent API responses
- DTOs ready for JSON serialization
- Proper HTTP status codes for all scenarios
- Validation attributes on input DTOs

### **For Background Services**
- Notification user identification methods
- Cycle prediction calculations
- Pill reminder user filtering
- Email notification data preparation

### **For Authentication**
- User credential validation
- Role management
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token data preparation

## **Next Steps**
1. **API Controllers** - Create controllers that consume these services
2. **Authentication Middleware** - Implement JWT token generation/validation
3. **Background Services** - Email notification services
4. **Database Migration** - Set up EF Core migrations
5. **Testing** - Unit tests for service layer

## **Architecture Benefits**
- ✅ Clean separation between business logic and data access
- ✅ Testable components through interface-based design
- ✅ Consistent error handling and response formatting
- ✅ Reusable business logic across different endpoints
- ✅ Simplified controller logic
- ✅ Centralized validation and business rules

The Service Layer is now complete and ready for integration with the API layer!
